# Question: Explain the purpose of comments in Python and provide examples of different types of comments.

# Answer:

# Comments in Python serve the purpose of providing explanatory notes within the code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter during program execution and are solely for the benefit of developers for better code understanding. Comments help make the code more readable, document functionality, and explain complex parts of the code.

# There are two main types of comments in Python:

"""
Single-line comments: These comments are used for brief explanations on a single line. They begin with the # symbol.

# This is a single-line comment
variable = 42  # Another comment on the same line
"""


# Multi-line comments or docstrings: While Python doesn't have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, docstrings (triple-quoted strings) are often used for this purpose. Docstrings are used to document modules, classes, functions, or methods.
# """
# This is a multi-line comment using a docstring.
# It serves as documentation for the function or module.
# """

# def example_function():
#     """
#     This is a docstring for the example_function.
#     It provides information about the function's purpose and usage.
#     """
#     print("Hello, world!")
# Understanding how to effectively use comments, choosing meaningful comments, and utilizing docstrings for documentation are important aspects of writing clean and maintainable code in Python.

# We are learning about the single line comments.
print("This is code and debug") #This is just a basic print statement.
print("We are learning comments") #This is another print statement.

# we are learning multi line comments
