# In python everything is an object
class list:
    def cbhbcds():
        pass


a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a.append
# From this we can understand that there should be one method name append inside the class list which we are accessing by creating the class object.
print(a)
print(type(a))  # output: <class 'list'>
# Which means there is some class with name list and we are creating one object a for that class.
