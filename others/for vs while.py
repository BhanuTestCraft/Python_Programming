When to use the for loop:
1. Whe you know the starting and the ending point.
2. When you know the number of iterations/fixed no of iterations.
3. When you want to iterate over the iterable data type like list,string,dict.
4. There are some collections which do not support the indexing like sets and dictionary.

----------------------
When to use while loop:
1. When you do not know about the number of iterations.
2. When index is important for us.
